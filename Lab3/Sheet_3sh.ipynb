    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning in neural networks: \n",
    "Algorithms for specifying the parameters of a neural network in order to solve a given task: „learning“ / „training“\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Training set:\n",
    "Simply put, training data is used to train an algorithm. Generally, training data is a certain percentage of an overall dataset along with a testing set. As a rule, the better the training data, the better the algorithm or classifier performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Supervised Learning:\n",
    "Supervised learning is the Data mining task of inferring a function from labeled training data.The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a “reasonable” way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unsupervised Learning: \n",
    "In machine learning, the problem of unsupervised learning is that of trying to find hidden structure in unlabeled data. Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no error or reward signal to evaluate a potential solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Online (incremental) Learning: \n",
    "In this learning mode, learning is done after presentation of each individual training sample to the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Offline (batch) learning: \n",
    "In this learning mode, learning is done only after presentation of all training samples to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Training Error: \n",
    "The difference between the actual network output and the target output while feeding the set of training examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Generalization error: \n",
    "The difference between the actual network output and the target output, based on all possible input patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overfitting: \n",
    "Details of some training patterns are learned which are not relevant for most of the remaining patterns.  Underfitting: Model / hypothesis are not detailed enough.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cross-validation: \n",
    "The idea of cross validation is to split the training set into two: a set of examples to train with, and a validation set. The agent trains using the new training set. Prediction on the validation set is used to determine which model to use.\n"

    "##### Cross-validation- \n",
    "    Cross-validation is a powerful preventative measure against overfitting. Cross-validation allows us to tune hyperparameters with our original training set. This also allows us to keep our test set as a truly unseen dataset for selecting our final model.\n"

An (incomplete) python script for this experiment is provided the Jupyter notebook. Complete the code (model definition, selection and configuration of an optimizer and model “compilation” including selection of an appropriate loss function; see *# TO BE ADAPTED* in the Jupyter notebook); consult the Tensorflow Keras documentation if needed. Furthermore, select suitable values of the most important parameters (e.g. learning rate, batch size...). Then, apply the script for at least three different optimizers, for a suitable baseline model configuration. Report the final training and validation loss and accuracy values and provide plots for the training and validation loss and accuracy curves as a function of the number of epochs (see script). What are your conclusions regarding the comparison of the optimization strategies? Also report on the database statistics.\n",

To this end, modify the python script accordingly and systematically test the network performance. Provide the final training and validation loss and accuracy and provide the loss and accuracy curves as function of the number of epochs. You may also test further parameter settings. What are your conclusions regarding the network topology?  "
